# HPL-EMG-Processing
EMG Processing software for the High Performance Lab

This Matlab app is used to analyze the csv files acquired using the HumacTrigno data acquisition software also written in Matlab. It outputs the rms (root mean square) values and the mdf (median frequency) values for the two EMG channels. It also calculates the average torque for the same time window. All results are saved in a csv file called "results.csv"

It is primarily used in Tim Green's project.
